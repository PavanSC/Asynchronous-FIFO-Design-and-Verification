# Asynchronous-FIFO-Design-and-Verification
This project implements the design and verification of an Asynchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) module, commonly used for clock domain crossing (CDC) in digital designs. The asynchronous FIFO design ensures robust and efficient data transfer between two clock domains operating at different frequencies
